Rookie Cookie Crush tries to remove GDPR consent cookie boxes

This is rookie cookie crush - an extension to remove cookie consent boxes
that appeared since a new GDPR law has been introduced in the European Union.
It will not always work but it will get better over time and free you from
accepting nonsense cookie consent boxes.

## Some background on the Cookie Law in the European Union

The European Union claims to protect users from data abuse by introducing
a law that requires visitors to explicitly declare consent with cookies
used on a site. As this law is created by politics, it fails completely.

Users are now presented with cookie consent boxes full of legal babel that
next to no user actually reads and few people really understand anyway.
This is a problem, but it is not the only problem.

Users are now accepting cookies and terms of use that help to abuse their
data - and now they even explicitly complied to some weird legal terms by
being nudged to agree as this is the only prominent option.

Though even some users read the agreement, most of them will not understand
it and still have only limited choice. Everybody still has to accept some
cookies termed as 'minimal technically required cookies'.

First of all, the minimum number of cookies that are technically required
is zero. Yes - you never need cookies. Never ever. That is why the idea of
minimal technical required cookies is wrong in the first place.

This Add-On remove cookie consent box wherever it can. Most pages will now
work as they did before the European Union introduced the cookie law.

## What is next

The race is now on. With no doubt, some websites will try to circumvent the
use of Rookie Cookie Crush. Others may realize that the whole concept of user
tracking with cookies is doomed and they will hopefully fix their website.

It could really be simple. Current browsers include a 'do not track' setting.
Web page providers should simply respect this setting and free users from the
cookie consent boxes.

Again: Nobody needs cookies!
